The [Site Bay recordings Page](https://my.sitebay.org/recordings) thanks to [PostHog](https://posthog.com), My Site Bay provides real-time recordings of how user's use your Site Bay hosted WordPress site. 


User observability is a powerful tool for understanding how users interact with your website or application. By tracking and analyzing user behavior, you can gain valuable insights into how users navigate your site, what features they use, and where they encounter problems or obstacles.

One way to implement user observability is through recordings. This involves capturing detailed information about user interactions, such as clicks, scrolls, and keystrokes. These recordings can then be played back and analyzed to understand how users are interacting with your site.

There are many benefits to using recordings for user observability. For one, recordings provide a detailed, objective view of user behavior. This can help you identify problems or opportunities that you might not have noticed otherwise.

Recordings can also help you understand the context in which users are interacting with your site. For example, you can see how users are navigating your site, what other tabs or windows they have open, and what devices they are using. This can provide valuable insights into user behavior and help you optimize your site for different user scenarios.

In addition, recordings can be a valuable tool for user research and user testing. By watching recordings of real users interacting with your site, you can get a better understanding of their needs, preferences, and pain points. This can help you make more informed decisions about design and development.

Overall, user observability with recordings is a powerful tool for understanding and improving the user experience of your website or application. By tracking and analyzing user behavior, you can gain valuable insights and make more informed decisions about your site.
