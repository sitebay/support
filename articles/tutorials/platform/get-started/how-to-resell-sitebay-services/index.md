## White Label Agency
Are you a website designer? Start your own web business and charge what you want. Use all of Site Bay's technical features and hosting, while you handle things like design and SEO.


## Things Resellers Should Keep in Mind

There are a few things agencies should keep in mind:

- All agencies, and the customers of agencies, are bound to [Site Bay's Terms of Service](https://www.sitebay.org/tos). If for any reason a customer of a Site Bay reseller breaks Site Bay's ToS, it is the agency who will be held accountable.

- Payments are to be made directly to Site Bay by the agency. If a customer of a agency fails to pay the agency for their services, the agency is still responsible for their plan payments to Site Bay.

- Site Bay Support can help with issues regarding the technical and hosting of your Site Bay sites, but issues related to your WordPress configurations are outside of the [scope of Site Bay Support](/support/platform/billing-and-support/support/#scope-of-support). 

### Site Bay API

The best way to resell Site Bay services is through the use of the Site Bay API. The Site Bay API provides programmatic access to the full suite of Site Bay services.
