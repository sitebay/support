## Email Addresses and Contact Information

Site Bay uses the contact information on file in your account to notify and bill you. 

## Passwords

Creating strong passwords is essential to protecting your WordPress and Site Bay accounts. 

The password you use for your Site Bay account on my.sitebay.org should be different from the admin passwords you use on your WordPress sites.

For security, we never store your passwords. This means that if you forget your WordPress admin password, we cannot recover it for you.

If you suspect that an unauthorized user has gained access to your account, you should change the password immediately.
