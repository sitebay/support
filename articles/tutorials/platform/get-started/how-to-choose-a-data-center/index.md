When selecting a data center for your website, it's important to consider the location of your visitors. A data center that is physically closer to your visitors will typically provide faster page load speeds, as the data has to travel a shorter distance. This can improve the user experience and make your website more responsive.

On Site Bay, all hosted WordPress sites come with a content delivery network (CDN) to help improve page load speeds for visitors from far away. A CDN is a network of servers that are distributed across multiple locations, and it is used to deliver content to users based on their geographic location. This can help reduce the distance that data has to travel and improve the speed at which it is delivered.


## Choosing a data center

CDNs are not always effective for dynamically generated content. Because this type of content is not pre-stored on the CDN servers, it still has to be delivered from the original data center. This means that if your visitors are far away from your default data center, they may still experience slower page load speeds for dynamically generated content.

To address this issue, Site Bay allows users to change their default data center. If you are located in London, for example, and most of your visitors are from the United States, you can change your default data center to a location in Ohio to improve the page load speeds for those visitors. This can help ensure that your website is fast and responsive for all of your users, regardless of their location.
