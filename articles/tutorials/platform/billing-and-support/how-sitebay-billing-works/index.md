We strive to create simple and clear billing policy. If you have a question specific to your account, please feel free to [contact Support](/support/platform/billing-and-support/support/) in My Site Bay.

## How Billing Works

All plans are offered in either monthly or yearly billing intervals. By subscribing to a yearly plan, you enjoy a 20% discount compared to subscribing monthly. Add-ons such as additional sites do not benefit from this discount.

Active plans are invoiced on the plans renewal date, viewable on your [Billing Dashboard](https://my.sitebay.org/account/billing).


Plans have a number of site visits allowed per billing cycle. If you are on a monthly plan, your usage period is the same as your billing cycle. If you are on a yearly plan, your usage cycle resets every 30 days, starting from when you purchased the plan. 
Your usage cycle is viewable in your [Plan Dashboard](https://my.sitebay.org/plan/personal).

A Monthly Cycle Usage Summary, including predicted usage, is viewable on your [Billing Dashboard](https://my.sitebay.org/account/billing).

We do not shut off or throttle sites enjoying a spike in traffic. Site Bay has High-Availability and Auto Scaling to handle sudden spikes in requests if your site goes viral.
However, if you go over your plan's allowed visits, you may experience [Overage Charges](#overage-charges).

### Example: Yearly Plan Usage Cycle

You subscribe to a yearly plan on February 08. Your plan will renew on February 08 next year, and your monthly usage cycle will be February 08 â€” March 08. At the end of your usage cycle on March 8th, if you do not exceed your plan's allowed visits/storage, you will not be invoiced and your usage cycle will reset. If you incur overage charges, they will be added to your next yearly plan invoice.

### Upgrading or Downgrading Plans

We do not want you to feel trapped, so we allow customers to change their plan at any time. Just click the Change Plan button in your Plan Dashboard and you can switch instantly for a prorated cost for upgrades, or refund for downgrades. If you expect to go over your plans allowed visits or storage, you may upgrade your plan and you will not incur overage charges if the overage is within the upgraded plans limits. 
You may not switch from a monthly to a yearly plan or vice versa.

### Cancelling Plans

You may cancel or reactivate your plan at any time in your [Plan Dashboard](https://my.sitebay.org/plan/personal).

## Visits

A visit is a unique IP to your site per day. You can view your visitor data in the Insites Analytics Dashboard. We use these same logs to calculate your unique visitors. 

## Storage

Site Bay tracks the **average** disk use over your plan's billing cycle.

### Average Storage Example
  - Let's say you are on the Starter Plan with 8GB of storage.
  - You use 10GB of storage from February 8th to February 23rd (Half a month)
  - You use 6GB of storage from February 24th to March 8th
  - This averages to 8GB average storage for the cycle, so you will **not** be charged overage

## Overage Charges
Overage charges are **$0.80 per 1000 visits** over your allowed visits per billing cycle and **$0.80 per GB** average storage over your allowed storage.
Bandwidth overages are **not charged**
If you expect to go over your plans allowed visits or storage, you may upgrade your plan and you will not incur overage charges if the overage is within the upgraded plans limits. 

{{< note >}}
View your [Predicted Overage](/support/platform/billing-and-support/manage-billing-in-cloud-manager/#viewing-current-balance) to keep track of your usage throughout your plan's cycle.
We will email you if you are expected to go over your allowed visits or storage.

## Mid-Cycle Overage Billing

You may receive an invoice from Site Bay if you reach the overage threshold of **$200** used within a single monthly billing cycle. 
The vast majority of users will nou must pay the mid-month bill before you can create additional Site Bay WordPress sites.

## Payment Methods

We accept Visa, MasterCard, Discover, and American Express and require that the address affiliated with a card matches the billing information on your account. We also accept Apple Pay and you can add money to your account balance in our app with App Store gift cards. We do not accept bank/wire transfers.
