Introducing a new tool that allows you to reverse proxy a Shopify store to a directory on your WordPress site:

## Shopify Connect

Are you a WordPress user who wants to integrate a Shopify store into your site? Do you want to have your Shopify features appear on your WordPress site, without redirecting your users to a separate Shopify page? Then our new reverse proxy tool is for you!

Our tool allows you to easily connect your Shopify store to a directory on your WordPress site using a Shopify app extension. This means that your Shopify features will appear on your WordPress site, just like any other WordPress page or post. Your users will be able to browse and purchase your features without ever leaving your site.

To use our reverse proxy tool, follow these steps:

    Install and activate the Shopify app extension on your WordPress site.

    Go to your Shopify app settings and enter the URL for the directory on your WordPress site where you want your Shopify features to appear.

    Save your settings and visit the directory on your WordPress site where you entered your Shopify store URL. You should now see your Shopify features on your WordPress site.

A new tool allows WordPress users to easily connect their Shopify store to a directory on their WordPress site using a Shopify app extension. This allows users to have their Shopify features appear on their WordPress site without redirecting their users to a separate Shopify page. This provides a seamless experience for users and makes it easier for WordPress users to integrate their Shopify store into their site.
