## What is High Availability?

High availability (HA) is a term that describes a website or application with maximum potential uptime and accessibility for the content stored on it. While a more basic system will be adequate to serve content to a low or medium number of users, it may include a single point of failure. This means that if one server goes down, whether due to traffic overload or any number of other issues, the entire site or application could become unavailable.

Systems with high availability avoid this problem by eliminating single points of failure, which prevents the site or application from going down when one component fails.

## What High Availability is Not

High availability does **not** mean your site or application will never go down. Although it provides a number of failsafes, and aims for a 99.999% uptime, no system is perfect.

However, because highly available systems are made up of so many components, they can be scaled horizontally when needed, thus improving their ability to serve content.
