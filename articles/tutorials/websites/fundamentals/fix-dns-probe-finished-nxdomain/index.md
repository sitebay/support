## What does DNS_PROBE_FINISHED_NXDOMAIN mean?

NXDOMAIN just means that is domain does not exist. If your domain is unable to resolve via DNS, this error returns.

## Troubleshooting

1. Check your DNS records and make sure the entry exists. If the site you are trying to reach is test.example.org, go to your DNS manager and enter the address it points to in your browser to make sure it resolves.

2. Check for typos in both the DNS record name AND value.

3. Wait a few minutes. Sometimes it takes a moment for your DNS server to update.

4. Renew Your IP Address.
