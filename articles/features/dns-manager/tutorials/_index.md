## DNS manager

You can manage your DNS records using our user-friendly dashboard. This allows you to add, edit, and delete DNS records as needed. Some common DNS records that you may want to manage include A records (which map a domain or subdomain to an IP address), CNAME records (which map a domain or subdomain to another domain), and MX records (which specify the mail server for a domain).
