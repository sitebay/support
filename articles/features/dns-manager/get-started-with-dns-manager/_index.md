## Add a Domain

If you're new to Site Bay, or if you've just purchased a new domain name, the first step is to add a new domain. Domains can be created and managed in the **Domains** section of the Cloud Manager.

{{< note >}}
Domains can't be purchased through Site Bay. Buy a domain through a *registrar* like Cloudflare.
